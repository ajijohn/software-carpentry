#day 4 challenges

#Challenge
# Q(a) Create a new dataframe from surveys , remove observations with missing(weight,hindfoot_length and sex)
# Q(b)  select only those species for which the count >=50
# Q(c)  Filter only those species from (b) with  criteria from (a), and write it to folder "data_output/surveys_complete.csv"


#2
#Challenge
#Q Scatter plot of weight(y-axis) over species _id(x-axis), with plot types showing in diff color
# 

#3
#Challenges ( exploring the shape of distributions)
# Q(a) Check shape (use geom_violin() ) - beneficial to see bimodality in distribution
# Q(b) Rescale a variable - to better distribute the observations in the space of the plot, use scale_y_log10()
# Q(c) Check some other variable i.e. explore its distribution, use hindfoot_length . 
#       - Use boxplot to see distribution of hindfoot_length
#       - Overlay it on top of a jitter layer of measurements
#       - color the datapoints with the plot_id (showing from where the observation was taken)

#4 Theme customizations
#Challenge (Take few minutes to experiment with other options)
